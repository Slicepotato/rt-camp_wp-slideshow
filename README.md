# rt-camp_wp-slideshow
Programming submission for rtCamp Assessment

## WordPress Plugin Challenge
There are already more than 10000 WordPress plugins out there. So itâ€™s really hard to set up a challenge for you! Still, we need to create a playground for you. So we came up with a few ideas for the plugin. Go ahead with anyone below:

### Challenge-1: WordPress-Slideshow Plugin
This plugin will test if you are familiar with WordPress shortcodes.

### Admin-Side:
- Create an admin-side settings page.
- Provide an interface to add/remove images from plugin settings page.
- User must be able to change order of uploaded image. (Hint: Use http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists )

### Front-end:
- Create provision for a shortcode like [myslideshow]
- When you add shortcode [myslideshow] to any page, it will be replaced by a slideshow of images uploaded from admin-side.
- You can use any jQuery slideshow library/plugin.

## MVP Update
Updated and finalized implementation upon plugin installation.
> usage: `[rtcampslideshow]` is desired slideshow shortcode implementation
